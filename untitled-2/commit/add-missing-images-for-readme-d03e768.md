|  |  |  |
|  |  |  The example above will search for repositories with the string "hello-world" in their name. Internally this uses the \[Github Search syntax\]\[github-search\], so you can use modifiers like: |
|  |  |  |
|  |  |  gh hello-world stars:&gt;100 |
|  |  |  !\[gh hello-world stars:&gt;1000\]\(docs/gh-hello-world-stars-1000.png\) |
|  |  |  |
|  |  |  This will search only in repositories that have more than 100 stars. |
|  |  |  This will search only in repositories that have more than 1000 stars. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  |  &gt; Please note that this command only searches in the repository name. This means that your query will be appended with the \`in:name\` modifier. So when you type in \`hello-world\`, the final search query sent will be: "hello-world in:name". |
