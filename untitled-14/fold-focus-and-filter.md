# Fold, Focus, & Filter

TaskPaper gives you three ways to filter your lists; fold, focus, and filter.

## Folding <a id="folding"></a>

Expand and collapse items to control the level of detail that you see.

* Click an item's handle to expand/collapse its sub-list.
* Use Outline &gt; Expand Items \(Command-0\) to expand items.
* Use Outline &gt; Collapse Items \(Command-9\) to collapse items.
* When you move a collapsed item its children move along with it.
* Use Outline &gt; Expand All By Level \(Shift-Command-0\) to expand one level at a time.
* Use Outline &gt; Collapse All By Level \(Shift-Command-9\) to collapse one level at a time.

Each Expand/Collapse command has a "Completely" variant that you can see and access by holding down the Option key. For example Option-Command-0 will expand the current item completely. Expanding it and all descendant items.

## Focusing <a id="focusing"></a>

Focusing zooms you into a particular project hiding everything else.

* Click a project in the sidebar to focus it.
* Click the "Home" item in the sidebar to unfocus and show your entire list.
* Use Option-Click on a projects handle to focus the project.
* Use Palette &gt; Go to Anything \(Command-P\) to choose a project to focus.

## Filtering <a id="filtering"></a>

Filtering hides items that don't match the search in the searchbar.

* Use View &gt; Begin Editor Search \(Command+Shift+F\) to start searching.
* Click a @tag in your list to search based on that tag.
* Click a @tag's associated value in your list to search based on that tag and value.
* Use Palette &gt; Go to Anything \(Command-P\) to choose a saved search or tag to filter by.

You can create logical searches:

* `not @done` – Shows all items that are not tagged with @done.
* `@done and @today` – Shows all items tagged with @done AND with @today.
