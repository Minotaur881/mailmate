1. 2.  [Use quotes and sentences for alert messages](https://github.com/ksalzke/estimate-total-time-omnifocus-plugin/commit/36ac2fe3a2b29d5437839106ac0de264c92e9151)

   ```text
   Good macOS and iOS style is to use complete sentences in alerts and also
   to quote values that could contain spaces, commas, or other punctuation.
   Make the alert presented by this plug-in conform to this style.
   ```

   ```text
   Remove the reference to the kaitlinsalzke.com instructions for getting
   started with Omni Automation because they contain a note saying that
   they are out of date and refer the reader to a different document.

   Update the instructions to match the current GitHub UI.

   Reference the "Omni Automation: Installing Plug-Ins" document for how to
   install the plug-in.
   ```
