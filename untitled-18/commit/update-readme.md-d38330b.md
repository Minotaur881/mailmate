|  |  |  \#\# What is this? |
|  |  |  |
|  |  |  This is a tool that synchronises data from \[OmniFocus\]\(http://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus\) with a \[LeanKit\]\(https://leankit.com\) or \[Trello\]\(https://trello.com\) board. |
|  |  |  This is a tool that synchronises data from \[OmniFocus\]\(http://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus\) to a Kanban board \(e.g. \[KanbanFlow\]\(https://kanbanflow.com/\)\). |
|  |  |  |
|  |  |  \#\# Why? |
|  |  |  |
|  |  |  This allows you to visualise your Omnifocus data on a Kanban board or task board. I prefer this to manage my work in progress than using Omnifocus alone. Here's a \[blog I wrote\]\(http://rhydlewis.net/blog/2015/9/29/how-i-use-personal-kanban-to-stay-in-control-of-my-work-and-get-stuff-done-part-2\) with more info on my thinking. |

|  |  |  This tool needs these libraries to function correctly: |
|  |  |  |
|  |  |  \* requests \(2.11.1\) |
|  |  |  \* trello \(0.9.1\) |
|  |  |  \* docopt \(0.6.2\) |
|  |  |  \* sqlalchemy |
|  |  |  This tool needs Python 3 and \[these libraries\]\(https://github.com/rhydlewis/omnifocus-to-kanban/blob/master/requirements.txt\) to run. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  |  Run: |
|  |  |  |
|  |  |  \`python setup.py install\` |
|  |  |  \`pip install -r requirements.txt\` |
|  |  |  |
|  |  |  to install them. |

|  |  |  |
|  |  |  \#\#\# LeanKit |
|  |  |  |
|  |  |  \#\#\#\# Configuration |
|  |  |  |
|  |  |  Copy the \`leankit-config.yaml.example\` file as \`leankit-config.yaml\`. Edit the file as follows: |

|  |  |  email: your Leankit email address |
|  |  |  password: your Leankit password |
|  |  |  account: your Leankit account name |
|  |  |  board\_id: your board ID |
|  |  |  completed\_lanes: |
|  |  |  - list of Leankit lane ID's that indicate which lanes contain completed work |
|  |  |  |
|  |  |  If you don't know the lane ID's for your board, use: |
|  |  |  |
|  |  |  \`./bin/leankit-lanes\` |
|  |  |  |
|  |  |  \#\#\#\# Running |
|  |  |  |
|  |  |  \`./bin/of-to-kb --leankit\` |

|  |  |  \#\#\#\# Configuration |
|  |  |  |
|  |  |  Copy the \`trello-config.yaml.example\` file as \`trello-config.yaml\`. Edit the file as follows: |
|  |  |  |
|  |  |  app\_key: your trello key |
|  |  |  token: your trello token if you use a private board |
|  |  |  board\_id: your PK board id |
|  |  |  default\_list: the ID of the list in which you want the tool to add new cards into |
|  |  |  completed\_lists: |
|  |  |  - ID's of lists in which completed cards are found |
|  |  |  |

|  |  |  \#\#\# Kanban Flow |
|  |  |  |
|  |  |  1. Copy the \`kanbanflow-config.yaml.example\` file as \`kanbanflow-config.yaml\`. Edit the file to include your API token, lane IDs and contexts. |
|  |  |  2. Run \`of-to-kb --kanbanflow\` |
