1.  [Try to improve behavior on Twitter](https://github.com/mhucka/devonthink-hacks/commit/40af43d41b5c4f19dcdf6c629b46ead512ddffcc)

   ```text
   In an effort to improve captures of tweets, I added awful hacks like
   scrolling to the top *twice*. Sometimes Twitter with in particular,
   attempting to go back to the top doesn't, and ends up in some random
   location.  Trying to go back to the top a second time actually seems
   to help, as stupid as that seems.
   ```

2. 3. 4.  [Cannot compile the fragment, so remove the .scpt](https://github.com/mhucka/devonthink-hacks/commit/bc806f23f53271dcad9fc64739e0945987dd850b)

   ```text
   As part of a cleanup of the previous code, I removed the "tell
   application DEVONthink" part because it's unnecessary (the whole thing
   is meant to run in DEVONthink, after all).  However, this made it
   impossible to compile.  So, can't keep a compiled version here.
   ```
