This is where I keep applescripts, smart rules, templates and css for markdown. If you see something useful and want to improve upon it, be my guest.

* [DEVONthink 3 Snapshot Mechanism](https://github.com/bcdavasconcelos/DEVONthink-3-Snapshot-Mechanism) now has its own repository. \(2020-06-09-12-20-40\)
* [DEVONthink 3 Backlinks](https://github.com/bcdavasconcelos/DEVONthink-3-Backlinks) now has its own repository. \(2020-06-09-13-13-40\)

For many applescripts, you will need the script RegexAndStuffLib \([available here](https://latenightsw.com/support/freeware/)\) in `~/Library/Script Libraries`.
