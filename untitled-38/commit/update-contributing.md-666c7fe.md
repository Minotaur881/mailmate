|  |  |  |
|  |  |  - This original version and content of the guide is maintained in English. |
|  |  |  - Translations follow the content of the original. Unfortunately, contributors must speak at least some English, so that translations do not diverge. |
|  |  |  - \*Translations follow the content of the original.\* Note this means contributors to a translation must be able to read some English, so that translations do not diverge \(unless it is only fixing a typo\). |
|  |  |  - Each translation has a maintainer to update the translation as the original evolves and to review others' changes. This doesn't require a lot of time, but review by the maintainer is important to maintain quality. |
|  |  |  - See the \[AUTHORS.md\]\(AUTHORS.md\) file for current maintainers. \(This file is generated from the \[authors-info.yml\]\(admin/authors-info.yml\) file.\) |

|  |  |  Translations to new languages are always welcome, especially if you can maintain the translation! |
|  |  |  Translations to new languages are always welcome! Keep in mind a transation must be maintained, so it's needed to have one person maintain each translation. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  |  - Check existing issues to see if a translation is in progress or stalled. If so, offer to help. |
|  |  |  - Do you have time to be a maintainer for the new language? Please say so so we know we can count on you in the future. |
|  |  |  - If it is not in progress, file an issue for your language so people know you are working on it and we can arrange. Confirm you are native level in the language and are willing to maintain the translation, so it's not orphaned. |
|  |  |  - To get it started, fork the repo, then submit a PR with the single file README-xx.md added, where xx is the language code. Use standard \[IETF language tags\]\(https://www.w3.org/International/articles/language-tags/\), i.e. the same as is used by Wikipedia, \*not\* the code for a single country. These are usually just the two-letter lowercase code, for example, \`fr\` for French and \`uk\` for Ukrainian \(not \`ua\`, which is for the country\). For languages that have variations, use the shortest tag, such as \`zh-Hant\`. |
|  |  |  - Invite friends to review if possible. If desired, feel free to invite friends to help your original translation by letting them fork your repo, then merging their PRs. |
|  |  |  - \*Invite friends to review\* if possible. Tranlsations are difficult and usually have erros others need to find. If desired, feel free to invite them to help your original translation by letting them fork your repo, then merging their PRs. |
|  |  |  - Add links to your translation at the top of every README\*.md file. \(For consistency, the link should be added in alphabetical order by ISO code, and the anchor text should be in the native language.\) |
|  |  |  - When done, indicate on the PR that it's ready to be merged into the main repo. |
