Call `dconf` followed by any piece of text, and Alfred will look for it inside `~/Library` \(ignoring some common sources of false positives\).

To act on the selections, use the standard Alfred shortcuts. You can activate file actions, dive into directories, preview files, add them to the file buffer — whatever you want to do that is supported by Alfred.

The goal of the Workflow is that you select what you recognise as setting you want to delete after uninstalling an app, add them to Alfred’s File Buffer, and then delete them all.
