# brandonpittman/OmniFocus

While OmniFocus may not have built-in "if foo then bar" capabilities, we can make a meta-task to handle those kinds of situations. This script will prompt you for an _If_ clause if the task's name doesn't start with _If_. If it already does, it'll just remove the _If ~:_ prefix. The script is ready to go for LaunchBar as well.
