|  |  |  While OmniFocus may not have a built-in "if foo then bar" capabilities, we can make a meta-task to handle those kinds of situations. This script will prompt you for an \*If\* clause if the task's name doesn't start with \*If\*. If it already does, it'll just remove the \*If ~:\* prefix. The script is ready to go for LaunchBar as well. |
