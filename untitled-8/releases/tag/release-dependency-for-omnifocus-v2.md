# Release Dependency For OmniFocus v2

This plugin, previously a set of scripts, has now been upgraded to a full plugin.

In addition, this iteration works with projects as well as regular tasks, uses a function library that can be accessed outside the plugin, and the ‘Complete For Prerequisite’ action now also checks parent \(and other descendant\) tasks of the completed task for dependant tasks.
